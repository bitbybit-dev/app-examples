These app examples are meant to show how bitbybit-core and bitbybit-occt npm packages can be used to create 3D models on the browser and on the server.
bitbybit-core library works only on the browser and is dependant on many great 3D libraries. bitbybit-occt library is much more versatile and can be used both on the nodejs and browser applications.

Visit https://bitbybit.dev to use our full cloud platform.

# App Example Frameworks
For browser based applications we provide few examples using bitbybit-core library by using most popular frameworks such as React and Angular. For Node based applications we provide express server app example and a simple node example.

# Principles
Bit By Bit Developers company will keep these core algorithms that you can find in this repository free and opensource for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from public.

# About Bit By Bit Developers platform
Bit By Bit Developers web platform allows creators to program geometry through simple visual programming language or choose monaco typescript editor with full intellisense of bitbybit API. This cloud platform can fulfil many practical, educational and artistic needs of its users. Through familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.
